## Usage

The Prework Study Guide Webpage can be used to view notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. It can also be used to help decide which topic you might want to study first. If you inspect the page and navigate to the console, Javascript will be seen running, and will list and choose a topic for you to study.
